# **kwargs is used to pass keyworded parameter, argument lists... double star helps us to pass keyword arguments.
# One can think of the kwargs as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it.
# That is why when we iterate over the kwargs there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed out
